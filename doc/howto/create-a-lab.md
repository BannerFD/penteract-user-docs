The Penteract teach page allows you to build and distribute lab prototypes to your students. If you are not a teacher in the traditional sense don't worry there is still something you know that other people would be interested in learning.

Let's have a look at some of the components that make up the teach page. 

1. These are quick statistics that help you understand the types of courses you are building and help you plan future courses. 
2. This section shows you four lab prototypes you have built or are in the process of building. You can always click the `view more` button to see a full list of the content you have created. 
3. Each lab in the list contains high-level information about the lab. The `published`/`draft` label in the top left corner indicates whether this lab will appear in the lab catalogue for other students. Note **even published labs will only appear in the catalogues of students to whom the lab is distributed to**. The diagram in the under the lab image display a top-level overview of the knowledge, skills, tasks, and abilities that this lab assesses. In the bottom section of the lab overview the work role is displayed along with the rating of the lab the xP and the estimate time the lab should take. Most of these details can be edited by clicking on the lab. 
4. This section allows you to see the groups you have access to. A group is a set of users to which you can give access to your labs. You can create a group using the `+` button, or view/update the users in a group by clicking on the groups name.
