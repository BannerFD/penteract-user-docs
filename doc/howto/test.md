1. The learn link directs you to your [learning dashboard](/v3/howto/learn-page). On the learning dashboard you can view your [Penteract DNA](/v3/howto/penteract-dna), the labs you are currently enrolled in, and a catalogue of all labs available to you.
2. The teach link will take you to your [teaching dashboard](/v3/howto/teach-page). Depending on your account permissions this link might not be visible to you. In your teach dashboard you can create lab prototypes and manage groups.
3. The administration links to your [administration dashboard](/v3/howto/admin-page). The administration dashboard allows you to manage credits distribution within your organisation.
