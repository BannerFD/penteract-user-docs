# Penteract Navigation

The Penteract navigation bar provides quick access to areas you may need to visit frequently.

1. The learn link directs you to your [learning dashboard](/v3/howto/learn-page). On the learning dashboard you can view your [Penteract DNA](/v3/howto/penteract-dna), the labs you are currently enrolled in, and a catalogue of all labs available to you.
2. The teach link will take you to your [teaching dashboard](/v3/howto/teach-page). Depending on your account permissions this link might not be visible to you. In your teach dashboard you can create lab prototypes and manage groups.
3. The administration links to your [administration dashboard](/v3/howto/admin-page). The administration dashboard allows you to manage credits distribution within your organisation. 
4. Clicking the request credits button will open a dialog for you to request credits from your organisation administrator. If you are unsure of who this is it is best to contact the your Penteract instructor. 
5. The edit profile, help, and logout links help you to utilise the sites full potential. Clicking logout will remove all traces of your identity from the machine you are currently on. Note: **logging out only effects the machine you are currently on.** The help button will take you to the documentation page for the version of Penteract you are currently running. Edit profile allows you to update your user details. 

The Penteract navigation menu is a key part of the Penteract platform. The aim of this article was to familiarize you with the key components of the navigation menu. If you feel that this document was unclear or insufficient in any way please [follow this link](/contact/) to let us know.
