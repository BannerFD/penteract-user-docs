Each service should be well documented using the markdown README.md file.
Documentation is exceptionally important for working with services you are not
familar with so please take extra care when writing documentation.

## How to write documentation

Documentation must include the information on the following

- All Interfaces (How this service interacts with others such as HTTP endpoints)
- All Program Inputs
  - Argument Variables
  - Environment Variables
- Anything complex about the source code or business logic
- Anything noteworthy
